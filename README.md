An interactive music web app for tapping into your subconscious mind.

This project was originally developed for [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/)'s [Electronic Rituals, Oracles and Fortune Telling](http://eroft.decontextualize.com/) class at NYU ITP, Spring 2018. 

Since then, it has been presented as part of Rockaway Prom's [Liminal Instruments](http://whiteboxnyc.org/event/opening-reception-liminal-instruments-panel-discussion/ "Liminal Instruments")
 showcase in New York, NY and the [2018 Web Audio Conference](https://webaudioconf.com/ "2018 Web Audio Conference") in Berlin, Germany.
